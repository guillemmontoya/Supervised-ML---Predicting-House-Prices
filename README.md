# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply various Classification ML techniques to see which ones give the best results when predicting House Prices

# Methods Used
We use various Classification ML models to train and classify the data entries according to their price. To do so we use Pycaret, in the notebook you will see the analysis of the following models:
- SVM
- QDA
- NB
- KNN
- LDA
- RIDGE
- LR
- DT
- ADA
- GBC
- ET
- XGBOOST
- LIGHTGBM
- RF

# Technologies
Python
PyCaret

# Project Description
In this project we use a dataset that contains 13 features to predict the y variable that is the price, the dataset contains around 2k entries. We will be using various ML classification models through PyCaret to predict wether a house value is above or below a certain price range. We will then tune the model with the best performance and try to explain what are the most important features for that particular model when predicting the price
